[DMA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access) is a peripheral that can copy data between other peripherals and memory or between memory and memory. It used to be implemented in form of 
[separate IC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8237) in early days, but in modern µCs it is of course integrated inside the single chip.

STM32 DMA peripherals are able to copy data from memory to peripheral, from peripheral to memory and from memory to the other place in memory (for example from RAM to FLASH as StdPeriph example shows). There are two DMA controllers : DMA1 and DMA2 and both have 8 streams. I see a stream as a some kind of physical, bi-directional connection between the DMA controller and some other peripheral. Those 16 streams cover all (most?) peripherals meaning that one stream is connected to more than one peripheral. For example if one is about to send data using USART1 he has to use exactly DMA2_Stream7, or if he wants to receive data from SPI3_RX he has to use DMA1_Stream0 or DMA1_Stream2, because apparently SPI3_RX is connected to both of those streams (see table 43 and 44 in reference manual of STM32F407).

DMA works automatically meaning that if there is some new data it will be copied without user code (and CPU) involved. It is possible thanks to channels, which I imagine as signals (like GUI signals if you know what I mean) connected between DMA controller and the peripheral (there is also something called "arbiter" between them). Peripheral can send a request (signal) to the DMA if it has new data, and DMA can then process it. At the same time DMA acknowledges it has got this new portion of data, and peripheral releases the request. Each stream can "listen" to its 8 channels, so there are 2 controllers * 8 streams * 8 channels = 128 configuration combinations, and that way every peripheral can have its own communication path with the DMA.

Streams have configurable priorities in case two or more streams request DMA controller attention. If two or more streams have the same priority, then stream with lower number wins. The bit of hardware called "arbiter" manages those priorities and decides which stream goes first.

So here comes the first DMA test I wrote (tested on STM32F407-DISCOVERY). It writes to USART1:

``` cpp
#include <stm32f4xx.h>
